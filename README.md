## 🛤️ My Journey

## 🛠️ Open Source Contributions

## 🎸 Fun Fact
I once created a fake CMS login page that displayed Blini Cat staring at pancakes when someone entered their credentials.  
Security didn't improve, but team morale did. 🥞🐱

## 🎮 Coding Hobbies
When I'm not building web applications, I enjoy breaking things to understand how they work! My ADHD brain learns best through experimentation, which has led me to tinker with C++ as a beginner and explore the Ogre 3D game engine. Nothing teaches you programming concepts faster than debugging a spectacular crash! 🔥💻
